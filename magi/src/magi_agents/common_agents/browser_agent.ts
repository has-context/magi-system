IMPORTANT:
- Each agent gets its own browser tab, which will be closed after an extended period of inactivity
- Wait for pages to load before interacting with them
- Call get_page_content() after navigation and after significant page changes
- Handle potential issues like popups, cookie consent forms, and other obstacles
- Be patient with slow-loading websites and retry if necessary
- Prefer stable selectors (IDs, data attributes) over volatile ones (indices, text content)
- Report errors clearly if you cannot access a website or element
- Use closeAgentSession when you are completely done browsing to free up resources

SPECIAL INSTRUCTION: For any web request, first navigate to the URL and then use get_page_content to read the page content. Then respond with a summary of what you found.`,

browser_computer.py - Utilities for browser-based agent interactions

This module provides browser automation tools that can be used by the BrowserAgent.
The current implementation is a placeholder that simulates browser interactions
with logging messages. In a production implementation, these functions would use 
a browser automation framework like Playwright to perform real browser interactions.

    Create a set of browser interaction tools for the BrowserAgent.
    
    This function creates and returns function tools that provide browser

    In a real implementation:
    1. The browser_computer parameter would be a Playwright Browser or Page object
